Here is an overview of VeyronSCM plugin's source code structure.

src/main/java/io/v/jenkins/plugins/veyron_scm:
  - VeyronSCM.java:
    The main class that implements the logic of polling changes, initializing
    Veyron universe, updating code, parsing the snapshot, and generating the
    changelog file. The commit format used in changelog file is identical to
    the one used in the Git plugin so I can reuse their parsing related
    classes.

  - GitChangeLogParser.java, GitChangeSet.java, GitChangeSetList.java:
    These three classes work together to parse the changelog file and produce
    change sets that are recognized by Jenkins. They were taken from the
    Jenkins Git plugin. I only made minimal changes to make them work with
    VeyronSCM, e.g. changing the package declaration.
    (The original source code: http://git.io/0jM-9g)

  - ChangeIdAnnotator.java:
    This class turns changeID strings in the recent changes page into links
    to the corresponding Gerrit pages.

  - VeyronBuildData.java:
    This class captures the Veyron related build data, such as current build cop
    and revisions of all repos.

  - VeyronBuildCopTokenMacro.java
    This class will be used when other plugins (such as email-ext) expand
    the VEYRON_BUILDCOP token which stores the LDAP of the current build cop.


src/main/resources/io/v/jenkins/plugins/veyron_scm/GitChangeSetList:
  - digest.jelly, index.jelly:
    These two files are used by Jenkins to format recent changes summary and
    detail pages. They were taken from the Jenkins Git plugin.


src/main/resources/io/v/jenkins/plugins/veyron_scm/VeyronSCM:
  - config.jelly, help-veyronRootInput.html:
    These files are used by Jenkins to create UI elements for the VeyronSCM
    plugin. For now, we only have a "VANADIUM_ROOT" field.


src/main/resources/io/v/jenkins/plugins/veyron_scm/VeyronBuildData:
  - index.jelly, summary.jelly:
    These two files are used by Jenkins to render the detail and summary page
    of Veyron Build Data.


To build and use the plugin:
- Run: mvn install
- Upload target/veyron_scm.hpi to Jenkins using "Upload Plugin" at:
  http://dev.v.io/jenkins/pluginManager/advanced.
