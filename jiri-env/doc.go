Print vanadium environment variables.

If no arguments are given, prints all variables in NAME="VALUE" format, each on
a separate line ordered by name.  This format makes it easy to set all vars by
running the following bash command (or similar for other shells):
   eval $(jiri env)

If arguments are given, prints only the value of each named variable, each on a
separate line in the same order as the arguments.

Usage:
   env [flags] [name ...]

[name ...] is an optional list of variable names.

The env flags are:
 -color=true
   Use color to format output.
 -n=false
   Show what commands will run but do not execute them.
 -v=false
   Print verbose output.

The global flags are:
 -metadata=<just specify -metadata to activate>
   Displays metadata for the program and exits.
