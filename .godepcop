  <!-- The packages under devtools are used during daily development.  It is
       very painful when these packages cannot be built, since common operations
       such as bootstrapping the codebase, sending code reviews and running
       presubmit and integration tests will no longer work.

       Most packages follow the strict rule of only allowing dependencies on
       devtools itself and v.io/x/lib, to reduce the exposure to breakage. -->
